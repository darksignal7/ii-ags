# ii-ags || Forked from : https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/tree/ii-ags
Forked illogical-impulse (ags version) from end-4 dots , customized it a bit..

I don'use it for now. And surely there is bugs.
NOTE: Please note that you must have AGSV1 on your computer inorder this config file to work. Not the new version of ags.
(You can test it by typing agsv1 on terminal. If it doesn't give error it works.)
You can also download end-4 ii-ags with a command from its official github repo. Then copy .config/ags

NOTE!!: If you know how to customize agsv1 I recommend you to get the official ii-ags from [https://github.com/end-4/dots-hyprland/tree/ii-ags end-4github] and customize it that way because i didn't know customization back in the time and used css rather than className in so many places. So it can and will be hard for you to even change any widgets property (like size,position).

## Features (What features other than end-4 offers)
- Caelestia-dots like appaerance
- Styled popus (like caelestia)
- Bigger todo bar in left sidebar
- Prompts for AI sidebar (and now stays after a refresh of ags)
- Categories for todos
- Wallpaper selection in search bar
- Styled search bar
